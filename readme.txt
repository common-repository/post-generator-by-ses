Helps to create multiple products review posts with data from Amazon, eBay (UPN-matched) and YouTube (title match).

Given the Amazon product URLs:
1) Pulls the data from Amazon (title, image, description, price, affiliate link), YouTube (title and embedded video by a title-based search) and eBay (price by UPN matching search);
2) Applies an HTML template;
3) Creates a post with all the products data.

This plugin is in BETA version, please support the development with constructive comments and feedback.

Future options will include the following below. Please let me know which one you need the most:
